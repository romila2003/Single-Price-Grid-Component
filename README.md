## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Plain CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Eventhough I have gained a good understanding about Css Flexbox, this challenge helped me to practice more and adjust the position of the cards when its screen size changes. I feel more comfortable with responsive projects.

Css Grid - code: 

```css

@media screen and (min-width: 700px) {
    .container {
        display: flex;
        flex-direction: row;
        flex-wrap: wrap;
        max-width: 650px;
    }
}
```

### Continued development

For future developments, I should use more css grids into future projects and begin taking on more challenging responsive projects to test my skills. Also, I should begin learning the basics of javascript and implementing my knowledge into the challenges.
